    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>Jeon Jungkook, popularly known as Jungkook, is a South Korean singer, dancer, and songwriter born on September 1, 1997, in Busan, South Korea. From a young age, he showed an interest in music, performance, and the arts. He grew up with an older brother and was known to be a quiet yet curious child. His passion for singing began during his elementary school years, inspired by Korean and Western pop music. As he watched performances on TV and online, he began to imagine himself on stage, performing in front of thousands. He would often sing to himself, imitate dance moves he saw in videos, and develop a natural sense of rhythm and expression.

        Jungkook's passion for performance became more serious during his early teenage years. At the age of 13, he decided to audition for the Korean talent show Superstar K in 2011. Although he did not advance to the final rounds, his appearance caught the attention of multiple entertainment agencies. Despite receiving offers from some of the largest companies like JYP, Cube, and Starship, he chose to sign with Big Hit Entertainment, a relatively small agency at the time. He made this decision after being inspired by the words and leadership of RM, who was already a trainee there and would later become BTS's leader.
        
        Leaving his hometown of Busan to train in Seoul at such a young age was a major step. Jungkook lived away from his family and dedicated himself to his training under Big Hit's strict program. He underwent rigorous lessons in singing, dancing, and even rap, developing himself into an all-rounder. His potential was clear to his instructors and fellow trainees, who recognized his incredible work ethic and natural talent. Despite his age, he kept up with older trainees and consistently improved in every skill area. His journey from a shy kid in Busan to a confident performer in the making was both inspiring and challenging.
        
        As time went on, Jungkook developed into more than just a trainee. His strong sense of responsibility and ambition turned him into one of the most dependable members of BTS. He often stated that he looked up to his older members and wanted to learn from them, but over the years, fans and professionals alike began to see Jungkook as a role model himself. His transformation from a humble boy with a dream to a global icon is a story that continues to motivate fans worldwide.In 2022, Jung Kook featured on American singer Charlie Puth's single "Left and Right", which peaked at number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Later that year, he became the first South Korean artist to release an official song for the FIFA World Cup soundtrack with "Dreamers", which he subsequently performed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony. In 2023, Jung Kook released his debut solo single "Seven" featuring Latto, which broke numerous chart and streaming records. It debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, the Global 200, and the Global Excl. U.S. charts, making him the first Korean solo artist to do so, and eventually became the fastest song in history to surpass 1 billion streams on Spotify. His follow-up single "3D", featuring Jack Harlow, debuted at number five on both the Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, making Jung Kook the first South Korean solo artist to achieve two consecutive top-five entries on the latter.In 2011, Jung Kook auditioned for the South Korean talent show Superstar K during its auditions in Daegu.[6] Though he was not selected, he received casting offers from seven entertainment companies.
